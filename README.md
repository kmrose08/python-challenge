# python-challenge

Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
